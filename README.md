# Slider
This project was built for an Artificial Intelligence course 
in the DrRacket IDE. 
It concerns the employment of multiple search algorithms,
including: 
1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
3. Best-First Search
4. Branch-And-Bound+ Search

It employs a misalignment heuristic wherein
the number of tiles which are out of place
is used to sort the list of potential paths
toward the solution.

Many examples and expedient tools have been
created for use on this project inside of 
the slider.rkt file.

In the future, I may expand upon the current 
algorithms to add techniques like A* Search,
Beam Search, Hill-Climbing Search,
and others. All of these are based upon
the same general search algorithm found in
the general_search.rkt file.
